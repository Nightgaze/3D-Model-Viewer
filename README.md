# OpenGL 3D Model Loader

This is my first encounter with OpenGL and render programming.

###Visual Studio 2015 reports some problems with SDL2 symbols, I'm looking forward this.

###Open Source stuff used:
[SDL2]   - Because taking care of obtaining a window in Windows would take years
[GLM]    - Math library for OpenGL
[OpenGL] - Woop
